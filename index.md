Hey guys, this is me! Ilana James.
So I'm actually planning a 28-day challenge of **"doing something over nothing"** and now i plan on makeing use of this blog to write down the progress or more like journaling. yeah!
So let me fill you up. 
### yesterday was day-1 (3rd June 2025)
woke up at 9:00am getting almost 10+hrs of sleep 😌 ate breakfast, tried to get data from my old phone but failed. i thought i could do it on my own, turns out i have to get it from repair shop. yeah. 😏
Ate lunch at around 3:00pm , then digged into github to actually understand what it is (guess how far i've learned! 😌)
