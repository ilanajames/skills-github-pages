Hey guys, this is me! Ilana James.!

So I'm actually planning a 28-day challenge of <br> **doing something over nothing** <br> and now i plan on making use of this blog <br> to write down the progress or more like journaling. yeah! <br>
So let me fill you up. 
## Day-1 (3rd June 2025)
woke up at 9:00am getting almost 10+hrs of sleep (ik😬) ate breakfast, tried to get data from my old phone but failed. i thought i could do it on my own, turns out i have to get it from repair shop. yeah. 😏
Ate lunch at around 3:00pm , then digged into github to actually understand what it is (guess how far i've learned!😌) 
also in between there was modern family, karikku, etc etc.
karyamayitt we didnt actually do anything. browsed things like skills, placement prep, a-baja etc etc. 
then wasted all my time for this game which i got addicted to (just 4 hrs). slept around 1.30ish <br>
